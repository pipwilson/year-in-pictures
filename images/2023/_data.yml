    description: "I really like the look of this old printing-press typewriter thingy that we stumbled across in a random dusty barn, but I can't exactly put my finger on why. This feels slightly ironic, given what this device would have been used for back in its hay-day. Yet, the fact that I can't describe something as menial as a bit of \"vibey\" junk is no surprise really at the moment. It feels hard to put my finger on lots of things. How am I feeling? How has my week been? These used to feel like easier questions to answer. Maybe I'm less attentive. Maybe my ability to utilise adjectives has been seriously depleted by the numbing nature of Netflix. What I can tell you is that I slept the night through for the first time in months last night and I cannot put into words how amazing that feels."

We’ve never seen a Gurney Stove in any Abbey or church. According to the information sign, these stoves were made by the London Warming and Ventilating Company in the 19th century. They used anthracite (burns cleaner and more efficient than regular coal) which was claimed to be a cheap source of heat. They are now gas fired. The photo doesn’t convey the size - quite large.  Tewksbury is a bit tired.  There are 376 listed buildings and little alleyways to explore as well as an interesting Riverside Walk and Battle Trail. Well worth a visit. Hope you are all keeping well."

The ones we met were generally very relaxed, being used to human contact, but also quite vocal and inquisitive too. They also have distinct, individual personalities, which makes them fascinating to watch as they each behave differently and interact with you and each other in their own way.<br ><br >We really enjoyed getting to spend time in amongst them and also being able to walk a couple of them around a few acres of paddock.

They hadn’t experienced being on a canal boat. We all had a turn at steering although Captain Richard did most of the navigating. The crew did the locks. We needed Tony to stand on the end of one gate in order for it to open while Jackie and I pushed. We had sun and showers so we were lucky as it was the unsettled weather part of May.

It is due to finish up near Colchester in 2025.  This pic is part of the 3rd section, 90km which goes from Grantham to Bexwell via Peterborough.
