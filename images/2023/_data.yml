    description: "\"That Wanaka Tree\" is something I stumbled on accidentally by Lake Wanaka in New Zealand's South Island. A lonesome tree growing up out of the lake with mountains in the background. Unknown to me, it's very popular with tourists, being marked in Google Maps and even having its own Wikipedia page. There were at least 50 people crowding around in groups, taking selfies. I had lined up this shot and had to wait patiently, in the end just pleading with one group to move aside for 5 seconds. Happy with the results."

    caption: "Putting It Into Words"
    description: "I really like the look of this old printing-press typewriter thingy that we stumbled across in a random dusty barn, but I can't exactly put my finger on why. This feels slightly ironic, given what this device would have been used for back in its hay-day. Yet, the fact that I can't describe something as menial as a bit of \"vibey\" junk is no surprise really at the moment. It feels hard to put my finger on lots of things. How am I feeling? How has my week been? These used to feel like easier questions to answer. Maybe I'm less attentive. Maybe my ability to utilise adjectives has been seriously depleted by the numbing nature of Netflix. What I can tell you is that I slept the night through for the first time in months last night and I cannot put into words how amazing that feels."
