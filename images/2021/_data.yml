    description: "I saw a woman use a glass orb last year so asked her about it and where she got it (Amazon - where else). So when trying to think of a Christmas present for Richard,  I remembered the orb.  He has a very expensive camera that is not being used as much as it could be as the phone is so easy, isn’t it. It’s been interesting and he is still working on technique. I held it once in my hand on a sunny day and within seconds my hand became really hot.  The speed was quite shocking.  Hope you are all keeping well. Life just feels a bit hollow at the moment but jabs for us oldies are hopefully coming soon."

Instead, my photo is of a parking ticket I received whilst out in London, despite having a permit in my windscreen. I fought the war, but I won. At least it gave me something to do this month and something different to talk about."

However, he's still quite shy around people a month in, but does enjoy being hand-fed live crickets!"

    caption: "Dogfish"
    description: "Unlike most of the UK there was not much snow in Devon (even on Exmoor) so I chose the photo that had the most impact on me. \r\nWhilst walking on Saunton Sands beach we were shocked to encounter over 40 dead dogfish on the strand-line. They had been slit on their underbellies and some of the flesh had been removed. Researching, I discovered they are classified as small sharks. Unfortunately, dogfish have little commercial value, but are often caught by fisherman as by-catch. The flesh has to be removed as soon as they are caught, otherwise the skin leaks ammonia into the flesh. Apparently they used to be widely sold by fish & chip shops as Huss or Rock Salmon."

The area around home is quite low-lying which, combined with all the rain over the last week, means lots of water where it usually isn't. The amount of water flowing from this lake / field across the footpath meant a fairly substantial detour, but at least I got a great photo out of it."
