    description: "I saw a woman use a glass orb last year so asked her about it and where she got it (Amazon - where else). So when trying to think of a Christmas present for Richard,  I remembered the orb.  He has a very expensive camera that is not being used as much as it could be as the phone is so easy, isn’t it. It’s been interesting and he is still working on technique. I held it once in my hand on a sunny day and within seconds my hand became really hot.  The speed was quite shocking.  Hope you are all keeping well. Life just feels a bit hollow at the moment but jabs for us oldies are hopefully coming soon."

They had been slit on their underbellies and some of the flesh had been removed. Researching, I discovered they are classified as small sharks. Unfortunately, dogfish have little commercial value, but are often caught by fisherman as by-catch. The flesh has to be removed as soon as they are caught, otherwise the skin leaks ammonia into the flesh. Apparently they used to be widely sold by fish & chip shops as Huss or Rock Salmon."

Difficult to take a camera out while we were in the lovely village of Painswick doing an illegal Treasure Trail. Then lots of grey, rainy days interspersed with cloudy days. However, the days are getting longer and we got our first jab which was really the highlight of the month. Near the end of the month, we were a bit shocked to have a sunny, windless and sort of warm evening.  It felt special.  So our photo choice is the lovely view by the fire pit. Hope you have all been enjoying the last few days of February sunshine and keeping well."

For me it's more just disconcerting to think of the very flimsy oneupmanship that must generally go on in marketing and how cheaply a word such as \"real\" can be applied.<br ><br >In all honesty, this nonsense waffle of mine is all talk. I purchased a jar and am making my way through it with a swagger, knowing I can saved £1.60 per jar whilst barely telling the difference between it and Hellmann's.
