    description: "I don't think I've ever walked so much in January!  The resolution to walk more came on the back of a Christmas shopping trip in late December.  I discovered, to my horror, that after weeks of resting my Achilles tendons, my whole body had weakened and walking felt like an effort!  So I resolved to walk as often as possible (and take up daily pilates).  The result of all this, besides improved strength and wellbeing, is a rather large collection of winter sunset pictures.  Which for me is a new thing, I normally hunker down inside in the winter months.  This picture shows a phenomenon that probably most outdoorsy people have seen often but for me was new: horizontal stripes of blue, then pink, fading back to blue.  I saw a lot of that in January on clear days and I guess it must be a winter thing?  Or maybe a January thing?  I'm fairly sure I haven't seen these particular shades of pink and blue in summer and I was so glad to witness it, it was magical."

But the ringing action is much the same as in a church tower, ie. each bell turning full-circle with the timing controlled to parts of a second to ring in set sequences."

    description: "Hopefully this photo has brought a smile to your face during these increasingly troubled times. I was staying in Bude, Cornwall. Unfortunately the  storms prevented my planned coastal walking so I headed inland along the canaI. It was a delight to spot 'Malcolm', the Mandarin Duck, so-called by the locals. Unfortunately he didn't appear to have a mate but seemed to enjoy the company of countless Mallard Ducks."

    description: "We all took the chance to take a break over half term and escape to the coast with some friends. One of the things we did to keep the kids busy, and to get ourselves out and doing something, was to visit Corfe Castle, the ruins of a medieval stronghold towering over a village of the same name.<br ><br >Plusses for this trip: it was only 15 minutes away, it's National Trust (so we could get in free with our cards), and they had a teddy bear zip line!<br ><br >So despite the not-so-nice weather, we had a (short) picnic, and watched the bears descend in their harnesses from the tops of the castle, before decanting ourselves to a nearby pub."

    description: "February saw my first work trip to London in around two years. It was a long day, and I remembered why I dislike commuting but I met a lot of lovely people for the first time (in person) and generally it was nice to be around humans again. I also got to see spectacular sights like this as I walked back to the tube, reminding me that there are aspects of London I miss.<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/51862261474/\">Flickr</a>."
