    description: "I don't think I've ever walked so much in January!  The resolution to walk more came on the back of a Christmas shopping trip in late December.  I discovered, to my horror, that after weeks of resting my Achilles tendons, my whole body had weakened and walking felt like an effort!  So I resolved to walk as often as possible (and take up daily pilates).  The result of all this, besides improved strength and wellbeing, is a rather large collection of winter sunset pictures.  Which for me is a new thing, I normally hunker down inside in the winter months.  This picture shows a phenomenon that probably most outdoorsy people have seen often but for me was new: horizontal stripes of blue, then pink, fading back to blue.  I saw a lot of that in January on clear days and I guess it must be a winter thing?  Or maybe a January thing?  I'm fairly sure I haven't seen these particular shades of pink and blue in summer and I was so glad to witness it, it was magical."

But the ringing action is much the same as in a church tower, ie. each bell turning full-circle with the timing controlled to parts of a second to ring in set sequences."

    description: "It's been about 9 months since I first setup the tropical aquarium my family bought me for Father's Day 2021, and quite a lot has changed in the last three-quarters-of-a-year.<br ><br >After initially setting up the tank with an impressive bubble bar, which created a lovely curtain of silvery movement, I later found out this over-oxygenation was likely the cause of my plants quickly dying. So that came out and a lot more plants went in (to keep the water's oxygen levels high).<br ><br >With an influx of new plants came a new problem: so-called \"pest snails.\" These things likely came in as eggs laid on the leaves of the new plants, which are hard to spot. They're even more difficult to get rid of once the snails themselves get a foothold. The natural solution? Fight snails with snails - specifically \"assassin snails\" - which set about digging up and eating any and all newly-laid pest snail eggs. Meanwhile I regularly fished out any grown pest snails with a small net, and sent them to the Land of Loo.<br ><br >It took 3 attempts to establish a stable Taiwan cherry shrimp colony--and by \"stable\" I mean they now reproduce like rabbits. Their high numbers don't seem to be a problem for the ecological balance of the tank though.<br ><br >Sadly, as seems to be increasingly common, my cardinal tetras all seem to have come bearing \"tetra disease\" - a highly varied spectrum of symptoms that cause different mutations and ultimately kill the individual fish. I've suddenly lost 4 of the original 7 in the last few weeks alone, which has been difficult to watch - especially when the cherry shrimp get involved in cleaning up. They don't thrive in groups under 6 in number though, so the remaining 3 will be under increased stress with fewer tank-mates. This will need remedying quickly if the remainder are going to stay (relatively) healthy.<br ><br >Which leads me to Haku, my mischievous and often-sassy blue Betta. Whilst he remains active and curious, I've noticed significant deterioration in his dorsal fin over the last couple of months. Bettas commonly suffer from a nasty illness called \"fin rot,\" which is a fungal infection that eats away the delicate tissues of their fins. Particularly bad infections can even attack their bodies, causing serious illness and death. I'm not sure this is what Haku is suffering from, but the tank has been dosed with a natural anti-fungal mixture for the past week just to be sure.<br ><br >I've been changing at least 25% of the tank's water every week now for many months already, treating it with tap water neutraliser each time, so I'm hoping it's not a dirty or dangerous environment that's caused the deterioration of Haku's fin. I think this means that water condition is the next thing to get more of an accurate understanding of though, as sticking with guesswork is likely just going to kill more fish."

A bit too much for us all that day, but enjoyed the sight, and the café made a welcome break before our next stop - an ice cream parlour!"

This is something I've made at home several times before, but mine contains entirely different base ingredients (and a lot more spice). This version was delightful and colourful and looks very impressive on a multi-tier cooking fire.<br ><br >Not pictured was the MurderFish incident, where a fresh Rainbow Trout was filleted (not by me) with the delicacy usually displayed by the Hulk when particularly angry.

Richard had a dinosaur of a PC and despite a lot of “nagging” on my part about buying a new one he resisted. So, I secretly bought the parts needed based on Ben’s specifications. We had to tell Richard eventually though so it wasn’t a complete surprise.  Richard is a former IT director so you would have thought this would never be a “nagging” situation. It was built in about 10 hours and the result has been super. It is quite wonderful when the son teaches the father something!"

The crowds were huge (understatement). They arrived with tents, umbrellas, coolers, kids, dogs and planted themselves in the fields. We had tickets in the stands thankfully.  It was loud and long and to be honest quite repetitive. There are only so many manoeuvres a helicopter can do. The most interesting displays were the aerobatic ones - Red Arrrows, Koreans, Italians, Jordanians. The air show was constantly running but when you needed a break you could go view the standing displays which included planes from all over the world.  Many people know where to view the show from the local area without entering the airbase. We just need to find out where those areas are for the future. It was difficult to choose a photo this month as we visited beautiful Tresco in the Isles of Scilly as well. The Koreans won out as you can see in the photo. We hope you are all well."

It’s the oldest and original model village in the world, first opening in 1929. All the beautifully made buildings, models and vehicles, including the many trains, are from the 1930’s."

How is it that summer is nearly over??"
