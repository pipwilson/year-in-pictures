    caption: "Stripes in the sky"
    description: "I don't think I've ever walked so much in January!  The resolution to walk more came on the back of a Christmas shopping trip in late December.  I discovered, to my horror, that after weeks of resting my Achilles tendons, my whole body had weakened and walking felt like an effort!  So I resolved to walk as often as possible (and take up daily pilates).  The result of all this, besides improved strength and wellbeing, is a rather large collection of winter sunset pictures.  Which for me is a new thing, I normally hunker down inside in the winter months.  This picture shows a phenomenon that probably most outdoorsy people have seen often but for me was new: horizontal stripes of blue, then pink, fading back to blue.  I saw a lot of that in January on clear days and I guess it must be a winter thing?  Or maybe a January thing?  I'm fairly sure I haven't seen these particular shades of pink and blue in summer and I was so glad to witness it, it was magical."
