During our stay we all went to Bend for a few days and on our way back to Portland we visited this beautiful area of high dessert, called Smith Rock. Formed during 2 different volcanic episodes millions of years ago, it is now a hiker’s and climber’s paradise. The river is called The Crooked River and the park probably gets its name from John Smith, a county sheriff who is supposed to have discovered it in the mid 1800s. I expect indigenous peoples knew about it long before."

Thankfully, nobody was around, and the only victims were a low fence and the back window of a black Ford Focus! <br ><br >The local council came quickly to cut it into sections to unblock the thoroughfare through the woods - not that you'd want to walk through it at the moment! It's so muddy due to all the rain.<br ><br >As I wasn't there when it fell, I didn't finally get to answer the philosophical thought experiment: if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

Turns out that enough water got into the freezer to render it not-so-freezing, so that ended up being taken to the recycling centre, and all of the content went in the bin."

This is for any player from the match that has excelled above and beyond for football skill in the match. The prize is a big bag of Haribo sweets (Supermix this week). I'm more a tangtastic fan myself! But he was thrilled he'd been picked out for his excellent defending! <br ><br >The smaller bag of sweets was because it was one of his teammate's birthdays, so Haribo overload!"

    description: "In April, we went Mudlarking on the north foreshore of the Thames in London near the Millennium Bridge. This was a guided tour lead by a licensed guide as you now need a license to Mudlark. It was really fascinating to see what you could find washed up on the shore - from bits of clay pipes to Tudor or Medieval pottery.  We also found oyster shells from which buttons had been cut.  Mudlarking was a profession in times gone by when children would salvage coal or other supplies dropped from boats. Now it's become so popular that the activity has to be controlled as too much damage is being done to the foreshore. We were allowed to pick up objects but could not take them away. A memorable day and one we had looked forward to for some time."

We are incredibly proud to have been a part of this 2 week long installation, helping to put up 1475 soldier silhouettes and 50 French Resistance figures, at the Normandy British Memorial, the number representing how many British soldiers lost their lives on the first day of D-day alone. An exhausting, emotional and fun week for us volunteering along with many others with the charity, Standing With Giants. You may have seen the BBC national news coverage and I’m sure there will be more as we get closer to the actual 80th Anniversary on 6th June. The finished installation, (this photo was taken just at the beginning stages) is spectacular and gives a real visual sense of how many people gave their lives for what we all have today, our freedom."

Dylan Thomas also had a boathouse nearby (yet to be visited) and the famous artist Turner painted a watercolour of Laugharne Castle, his sketch of it done in 1795 on one of his tours. Well worth a visit!"
