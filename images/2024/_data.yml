During our stay we all went to Bend for a few days and on our way back to Portland we visited this beautiful area of high dessert, called Smith Rock. Formed during 2 different volcanic episodes millions of years ago, it is now a hiker’s and climber’s paradise. The river is called The Crooked River and the park probably gets its name from John Smith, a county sheriff who is supposed to have discovered it in the mid 1800s. I expect indigenous peoples knew about it long before."

Thankfully, nobody was around, and the only victims were a low fence and the back window of a black Ford Focus! <br ><br >The local council came quickly to cut it into sections to unblock the thoroughfare through the woods - not that you'd want to walk through it at the moment! It's so muddy due to all the rain.<br ><br >As I wasn't there when it fell, I didn't finally get to answer the philosophical thought experiment: if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

Turns out that enough water got into the freezer to render it not-so-freezing, so that ended up being taken to the recycling centre, and all of the content went in the bin."

This is for any player from the match that has excelled above and beyond for football skill in the match. The prize is a big bag of Haribo sweets (Supermix this week). I'm more a tangtastic fan myself! But he was thrilled he'd been picked out for his excellent defending! <br ><br >The smaller bag of sweets was because it was one of his teammate's birthdays, so Haribo overload!"
