    description: "Waxwings are blown over in small numbers from Scandinavia every year to somewhere in the UK but I’ve never been in the right place at the right time. So despite seeing them abroad, I’ve never seen them in the UK. Then I heard there were 44 of them on the Common less than a mile from my house and I had to join the other 50+ birders watching them. Sorry this is a bit dark... it was taken on my phone through my telescope."

    description: "We stayed with our family in Portland, Oregon over Christmas and New Year. During our stay we all went to Bend for a few days and on our way back to Portland we visited this beautiful area of high dessert, called Smith Rock. Formed during 2 different volcanic episodes millions of years ago, it is now a hiker’s and climber’s paradise. The river is called The Crooked River and the park probably gets its name from John Smith, a county sheriff who is supposed to have discovered it in the mid 1800s. I expect indigenous peoples knew about it long before."

In all that I managed to find some motivation to get on with some Warhammer painting. I got a LOT done, which I'm relatively proud of. I painted some 8mm tall space marines (who went on to win a tournament, with some involvement from me), but I'm most proud of the terrain. I don't have a picture of it fully painted, but here was one mid-way of part of the board."

So I took a picture, had a few more sips and, noting that the facial expression had changed, took another picture.  And then a few more sips and another picture.\r\nIt went from smiley-laughy, to one eye exploded and looking worse for wear, to a full-on almost Grinch-like grin."

    description: "January has been such a stormy month! Terrible wind and rain across the whole country!<br ><br >Storm Isha was particularly bad in our area. Our road seems to act like some kind of wind tunnel, and there is a 300-year-old copse at the end of it. Unfortunately, one of the old trees was a victim of the storm.<br ><br >As you can see from the picture, the tree's roots were ripped right out of the ground. Thankfully, nobody was around, and the only victims were a low fence and the back window of a black Ford Focus! <br ><br >The local council came quickly to cut it into sections to unblock the thoroughfare through the woods - not that you'd want to walk through it at the moment! It's so muddy due to all the rain.<br ><br >As I wasn't there when it fell, I didn't finally get to answer the philosophical thought experiment: if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

With all the rain earlier in the month, at one point the water came to about 15cm from our backdoor. Unfortunately that meant that it did get into our log cabin / ex-outdoor office / current storage place for many things, which meant we had to completely empty it, remove all the floor tiles so things could dry out, and raise the freezer and wine fridge that were in there out of the water. Turns out that enough water got into the freezer to render it not-so-freezing, so that ended up being taken to the recycling centre, and all of the content went in the bin."
